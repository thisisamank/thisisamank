Hi, I am Aman! I am a pre-final year undergrad at Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Delhi, I am pursuing B.Tech in Information Technology and Engineering. I love to code and help new folks learn to code.

I joined Github **6** years ago. Since then I pushed **2043** commits, opened **27** issues, submitted **285** pull requests, received **44** stars across **96** personal projects and contributed to **34** public repositories.

I am a big believer of writing clean and maintainable code so my I try my best to follow the best practices in my apps. Sometimes I write blogs and you can find them [here](https://thisisamank.me). I am also active on [twitter](https://twitter.com/thisisaman01) and here's my [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/thisisamank). If my profile seems interesting to you can find my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GvwfkJ4UgMyIPdlRtXqkQ8HLf1dD0BBP/view?usp=sharing).

I am mostly working with flutter these days. However I'm also learning backend development. Apart from this I'm also learning core computer science subjects that are taught in my college (but on my own ofc?). I love music so you find me holding guitar or sitting with a keyboard someday :P
